It usually comes down to these steps:\nCreate a repository and name it username.github.io as the repository name. (In my case, it will be magsther.github.io) The website will be published at https://magsther.github.io/ Clone the repository to your computer. Cd into the folder Add an index.html Add, commit, and push your changes Enable and configure Pages (in GitHub) After a little while, you can visitusername.github.io to view your new website. Next step is to setup a GitHub Pages site with Hugo.\nHugo Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again. It is a popular static site generator, designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your website’s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.\nA static site generator is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and a set of templates.\nHugo works on macOS, Linux, Windows and you can follow the installation instructions for your platform here. Once the installation is done, we can just go through the Quick-start guide, which more or less comes down to this:\nThese are the steps that we will do:\nCreate a Hugo project (site) Choose a theme Install and configure the theme Customising the theme Add content by creating a post Run Hugo Creating a Hugo Project (Site) Start by cloning your repository to your computer.\ngit clone git@github.com:magsther/magsther.github.io.git\nCd into the folder and run the following command: hugo new site o11ycloud -f yml # creates the directory structure for your project\nJust a few more steps and you're ready to go: 1. Download a theme into the same-named folder. Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or create your own with the \"hugo new theme \" command. 2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files with \"hugo new /.\". 3. Start the built-in live server via \"hugo server\". Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation. Now we need to add a theme to your Hugo site, which is what we will do next.\nThemes Hugo provides a list of themes that you can use for your new website. If you are familiar with Wordpress then you will know how useful this is. Let’s first to go the themes page and select a theme that you like.\nI like the PaperMod theme, so I’ll use that one. Installing a Theme Follow the instructions for the theme on how to install it. You can also watch a YouTube video where the author will guide you through the process.\nWhen you select a theme it will give you instructions about the installation and configuration for that particular theme. I cloned the repository and copied the PaperMod themes folder into the root themes folder git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1\nI also replaced the config.yml file (in the root module) and made some changes to it.\nbaseURL: \"http://magsther.github.io/\" title: O11yCloud.com paginate: 5 theme: PaperMod ... .... Run Hugo To view the website locally, we can use Hugo’s development server. Just type in hugo server at the prompt, and it will start building the website. At the bottom of the output we can find a link on how we can access the website.\nStart building sites … | EN -------------------+----- Pages | 7 Paginator pages | 0 Non-page files | 0 Static files | 0 Processed images | 0 Aliases | 1 Sitemaps | 1 Cleaned | 0 Built in 32 ms Environment: \"development\" Serving pages from memory Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Press Ctrl+C to stop Open a browser and go to http://localhost:1313\nMaking changes on the “fly” If you open a new terminal and modify some of the content in the config.yml file you will notice that website is updated automatically.\nThis happened, because the Hugo process was still running in the other terminal and will build any changes that you make. Change of config file detected, rebuilding site. 2023-06-11 23:15:55.936 +0200 Rebuilt in 63 ms Tips, if you run hugo server -D then it will also included any posts that are in “draft” mode.\nAdding content To add content to your website, I first added a post.md file that was provided in the repository to the archtypes folder. You can think of that file as a template for all future posts. To create a new post, I typed in hugo new posts/example.md\nThis added an example.md file in the content folder. You can now open this file with your editor to create your blog post. If the Hugo process is still running and you are using the -D flag, then you will see that a new blog post is now added to your website.\nOnce you are done with the changes to your post, you can change draft: true to draft: false to have it deployed. This is depending on the theme you are using. If you are using the default theme, then Hugo does not publish draft content when you build the site This should give you an understanding on how to create new blog posts.\nCustomizing Hugo To further customize your new blog, just play around with the configuration file called config.yml located in the root folder. The first things that you probably want to change are the baseURL, title and the theme\nbaseURL: \"https://magsther.github.io/\" #This value must begin with the protocol and end with a slash, as shown above. title: O11y Cloud.com paginate: 5 theme: PaperMod Publish your blog to GitHub Pages When you are happy with how the website works on the local environment you can decide on how you want to host it. Here, we want to publish the blog to GitHub Pages. To do that, we need to run hugo to generate the blog. That will create a docs folder that you will need to add an entry for in the config.yml file for.\nAfter that, we add, commit and push them to the GitHub repository.\ngit add . \u0026\u0026 git commit -m 'new hugo blog' -a \u0026\u0026 git push\nNext, we need to enable GitHub Pages, which we can do by going to our GitHub repository and from there click on Pages. Enable it by changing the Source from None to Deploy from a branch\nSave your changes. After a short while, you will see that your blog is now published at https://username.github.io\nGitHub Actions You may have noticed that a workflow was created for you in GitHub Actions.\nIf you click on the workflow, you can see a summary of the jobs that are part of this workflow.\nIn the future, whenever you push a change from your local repository, GitHub will rebuild your site and deploy the changes.\nUpdating your blog To add a new post and publish it on your website, you can follow this workflow:\ncreate a new post with hugo new posts/example2.md build the site with hugo Add, commit and push the changes to GitHub git add . \u0026\u0026 git commit -m 'creating my second post' -a \u0026\u0026 git push Watch the workflow in GitHub Actions New posts are published at https://username.github.io Conclusion In this post, we looked at Hugo; how to create a blog and how to publish it to GitHub Pages.
